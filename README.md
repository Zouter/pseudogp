## Pseudogp - probabilistic pseudotime for single-cell RNA-seq

This toolkit fits pseudotime trajectories to (multiple) reduced dimension representations of single-cell gene expression data.

** Warning: ** This is pre-alpha software and comes with absolutely no guarantee of doing anything right whatsoever. Be weary of matrix inversions: computing posterior mean curves is O(n^3) for n cells.
